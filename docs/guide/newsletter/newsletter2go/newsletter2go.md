# Newsletter2Go

The Newsletter2Go plugin integrates the newsletter service https://www.sendinblue.com/newsletter2go/ into the API.

Newsletter2Go offers several address books. A user can be stored in one or several address books.
One address book equals one newsletter topic, so the user can choose if they want to subscribe to different topics separately.

Using several address books is optional. eZ Commerce out of the box works with the default address book only.
See the [Working with several newsletters](newsletter2go_cookbook/working_with_several_newsletters.md) if you want to support several address books.

In Newsletter2Go backend the address book can be selected in the header menu.
Every address book has a different dashboard with different mailings, receivers and reports.
