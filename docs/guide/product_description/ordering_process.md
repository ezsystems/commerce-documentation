# Ordering process

## Ordering

### Quickorder

This form supports the ordering process for B2B customers and reduces the time to set up an order.

A customer can enter several products and add them to the basket.

An upload function allows to upload a csv file containing a list of SKUs and quantities. Even more convenient is the drag and drop function.

Variant products can be added as well.
