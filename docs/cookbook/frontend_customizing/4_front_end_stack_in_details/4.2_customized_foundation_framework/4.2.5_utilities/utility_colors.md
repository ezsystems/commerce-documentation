#  Utility - Colors 

We use this utility to set colors. Currently it's just one color but it can be easily extend based on requirements.

## Sass

**File location**

``` 
scss/storm/_utils.colors.scss
```

### Available classes

.u-color-white

## HTML

``` 
<div class="u-color-white">
..

```

It sets white color for elements inside.
