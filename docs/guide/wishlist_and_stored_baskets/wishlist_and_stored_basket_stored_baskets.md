# Stored baskets

Stored baskets are available only for logged-in users. One user can have multiple named baskets.

You can store the whole basket under a name for later purposes and new stored basket will be created.

### Adding products to a stored basket

There are two ways to add products to a stored basket:

- You can add a product to a stored basket from the product detail page:

- You can add all items from the basket into a stored basket (choose a stored basket from a list or provide a new one).

In the pop-up you can either:

- save a new stored basket - if you do not have any stored baskets yet, you see a pop-up-window where you have to enter a basket name.
- choose existing stored basket - if you already have some stored baskets, you see a pop-up-window where you can choose which stored basket you want to add item to. You can also add a new basket.

If the product is a variant, you must choose all options to be able to add it.

Products stay in the stored basket until you remove them.

#### Removing products from a stored basket

#### Unavailable products

If a product is not in the catalog anymore, you can see a message in the overview page.
