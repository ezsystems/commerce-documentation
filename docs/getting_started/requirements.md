### Configuration notes

!!! note

    Please donÂ´t store session as a file on the file system. This might cause locking problems.

    Details see [Session handling](../guide/configuration/session_handling.md)

Please check if your webserver configuration (or varnish) blocks cookies which are not used in the application. 

The reason is that additional cookies might influence the caching behaviour in the backend. Some parts of the site are cached per session (e.g. the basket preview).  It uses an ESI block which uses a cache by Cookie.

The implementation of eZ Platform / the FOS bundle is building a hash using all cookies.  

For Apache you could use mod\_headers with an additional line for your vhost (this is an example, for apache v2.2.4+):

``` 
RequestHeader edit Cookie "^(.*?)YOUR_COOKIE_NAME=.*?(?:$|;)(.*)$" $1$2
```

For nginx in you vhost configuration:

``` 
set $http_cookie_updated $http_cookie;
if ($http_cookie ~ "(.*)(^|;)\s*YOUR_COOKIE_NAME=[^;]+(?:;|$)(.*)") {
  set $http_cookie_updated $1$2$3;
}
proxy_set_header Cookie $http_cookie_updated;
```

// install locally
cd app/Resources/

If you encounter issues in the backend with missing chart data in the cockpit please check this setting and restart mysqld\!
