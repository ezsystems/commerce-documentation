We use this page to collect all strange browser / OS related behaviour that may seem to look like a bug. 

## Window scroll with modal windows

http://rm.extranet.silversolutions.de/issues/10794

**Explanation:**

When there is a modal window with lots of content, in some browsers, when you scroll to the top / bottom and continue scrolling the window will also start scrolling. It's not a bug but a standard browser behavior. Noticed in Chrome (Windows, Mac OSX), Firefox (Mac OSX).

It's possible to fix with some JS / CSS (overflow:hidden property applied to body) but since it's a standard browser we don't recommend this.
