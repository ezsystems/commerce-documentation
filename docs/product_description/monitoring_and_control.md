## ERP Performance

Only if an ERP system is connected!

The ERP performance viewer shows the efficiency of the connection between the shop and the ERP system in a monitoring.It allows to see the number of the different requests per date and time.

The monitoring tool regularly checks the connection to the ERP via a test request.

## eMail archive

In the tab eMail archive the shop owner/admin finds all e-mails which were automatically sent from the shop, with date of despatch, recipient, subject and status. He can see the mails and resend them if necessary.

The eMail archive reduces the response time for the support and allows to resend an eMail to the customer.
