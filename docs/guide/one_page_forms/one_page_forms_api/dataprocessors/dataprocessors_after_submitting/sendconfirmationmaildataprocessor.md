# SendConfirmationMailDataProcessor

The goal of this DataProcessor is to send an email for these cases:

- When a private customer registers, an email to the user email address with an activation link is send.
- When a business customer registers, an email with all submitted data (including attachment) is send to an admin. The task of admin is to validate the data.
- When a customer, who has a customer number, was editing his profile data and the data was really changed be him (see [HasFormChangedDataProcessor](hasformchangeddataprocessor.md)) an email is send to the administrator.

For sending an email Symfony \\[SwiftMailer](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=EZC14&title=Configuration+SwiftMailer&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=23560759) is used.
