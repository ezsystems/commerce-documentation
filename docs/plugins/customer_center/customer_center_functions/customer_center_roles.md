# Customer center roles 

The customer center is using roles from the eZ Platform to assign rights to a user. They are configured in backend.

There is no limitation for user roles. One user can have multiple roles.

## Predefined Roles

<tr class="odd">

<td>This role is assigned to users, which can order in the shop. They additionally can have a defined budget, which they cannot exceed without approval.</td>

## How are roles defined?

**Configuration**

Each role has to be setup in the configuration file. There are 2 parameters which are responsible for roles:

``` 
parameters:
    siso_customer_center.default.main_contact_role: Customer Center Main Contact
    siso_customer_center.default.roles: [Approver, Buyer]
```

1.  First parameter defines a main contact role. There can be more that one main contact per company. The only limitation is that user with main contact cannot deactivate himself. This can cause a break in customer center and no possibility to login.
2.  SecondÂ parameter is a list of all available roles in the customer center. This can be extended with new roles.  
      
Those predefined roles should not be changed

How to setup a new role for a user

New role can be easily added in two steps:

1.  Create new entry in "**siso\_customer\_center.default.roles**" parameter to be able to use it in customer center.
2.  Add a role to eZ Platform backend. Example for Buyer below:

3.  Start using role to for example check rights to access some parts of website
