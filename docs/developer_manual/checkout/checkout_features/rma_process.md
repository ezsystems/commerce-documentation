#  RMA process 

There is a simple RMA process in eZ Commerce. The goal is to inform user about the cancellation policies and give him the possible to return his goods - online as well.

The cancellation process validates the input and sends an email to the shop webmaster.

## Checkout process

In the summary checkout process there is a checkox, where the user has to confirm that he accepts the cancellation policies. Therefore a textmodule is used. The textmodule can be configured by siteaccess.

```

```

The cancellation policies are rendered in the confirmation email as well.
