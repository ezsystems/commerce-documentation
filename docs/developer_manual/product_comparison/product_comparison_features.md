#### Public comparison lists

There are public lists which have their own URL (like `http://<site-host>/comparison/best-notebooks`), which are created and maintained by a shop-administrator. They cannot be removed nor changed by customers.

Public comparison lists are useful for example for promotion campaigns.

#### Product is not available

If the product is not in the shop's catalog any longer, it will be removed from the comparison list, implicitly, and a notification message will appear. The removal will only occur with an HTTP request to the respective comparison list. There is no background process which will remove all non-existent products from all lists.

#### Print functionality

Comparison lists can be printed by clicking the respective link in the left sidebar. The link will print the current page immediately without showing a print-optimized view.
