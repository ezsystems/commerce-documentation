#  Logging - FAQ 

### Frequently Asked Questions

Which log entries are stored in the DB?

By default ERP messages and emails are stored in the DB.

All other log entries are stored in the .log file.

I'm getting an error, that some \*log\* database tables couldn't be found.

Please update your database schema

**Command line example**

``` 
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update [--dump-sql|--force]
```

I need to log additionally missing translations (or something else) to the DB. What should I do?

If you need to extend the logging with a new DB log record, please read the [cookbook](#).

How do I invoke a simple log instruction

The ID for the standard logging is 'silver\_common.logger'. This is an instance of Monolog\\Logger. Thus, writing a simple debug log in a container action is like:

``` 
$logger = $this->get('silver_common.logger');
$additionalContext = array('exception' => $ex);
$logger->debug('My log message', $additionalContext);
```

I want to log a new created ERP message. How do I do that?

All transmitted messages are logged automatically, because the mandatory transport layer implicitly logs all messages. But if a new transport is implemented (other than the WebConnectorMessageTransport), this implementation hast to take care of logging measuring point a lower level. Please read the chapter [Measuring Points in the ERP logging documentation](ERP-Logging_23560301.html#ERPLogging-Loggingarchitecture:measuringpoints).

How do I log an email that is sent by the shop?

All emails, which are sent using the [MailHelperService](MailHelperService_23560658.html), are logged implicitly.

How can I avoid, that the password will be logged in the DB?

If the email contains a password, that should not be logged in the DB, you have to specify this password as a template parameter.

[MailHelperService](MailHelperService_23560658.html) will replace the template parameter *'password'* with *'\*\*\*'.*

Where can I find the log file?

 The standard log file is (relative to the shop's root directory) located at `var/logs/silver.eshop.log`

More precisely, Monolog's [StreamHandler](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/02-handlers-formatters-processors.md#log-to-files-and-syslog) is responsible for writing logs into files. The path the destined file is a [constructor parameter](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/src/Monolog/Handler/StreamHandler.php#L33) of the StreamHandler. For an example service configuration, please have a look at the [ERP Logging](ERP-Logging_23560301.html#ERPLogging-Configuration).
