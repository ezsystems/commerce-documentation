Advanced version only

In silver.eShop Advanced the order history allows to display invoices, orders, delivery notes or credit memos from the central ERP. It does not matter which channel has been used to create an order (multichannel). The orders can be made by phone, fax, email or via online shop.

A customer can reorder products easily:
