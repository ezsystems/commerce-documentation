# Customer Center functions 

The customer-center is available for customers having a flag in the ERP that the customer-center is enabled.

There are two important fields to be provided by the ERP:

  - a flag: company has a customer-center
  - the email address of the customer-center administrator

If a customer does not have a shop account yet he has to use the activation feature in the shop.

## Activation of the customer-center
The first step is to activate an account. During this process the shop checks if the customer has been enabled for a customer-center or not. 

The customer-center uses the existing activation function.  For a successful activation

  - a customer number
  - an invoice number
  - an email address which is defined in the ERP as a main contact

are required.

In case a customer-center is enabled for this customer, the shop will create a company and a main contact will be assigned to this company in the user section of the backend. If no customer-center is defined for this customer, a standard user will be created in the section "business users"

The customer will be logged in.
