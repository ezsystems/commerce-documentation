# Confirmation e-mail

The shop sends an confirmation email to the customer and to a sales contact (if configured).

In case of an failure (e.g. mail server not reachable) the issue will be logged into var/logs/dev/dev-siso.mails.log  (if running in prod mode the file is named with `env=prod`). 

The logfile contains the recipient, the email text and an error text

## Setting confirmation email address

Processing the confirmation email address is handled in the class:

`\Siso\Bundle\CheckoutBundle\Service\SummaryCheckoutFormService`

### Customer confirmation

The customer's confirmation email address depends on the user type and is stored within the basket entity during the checkout process in several steps. There are two options:

- **ANONYMOUS USER**- email address is taken from the Invoice Address of the basket entity, which is captured during the checkout process.
- **CUSTOMER WITH OR WITHOUT NUMBER (LOGGED IN)** - email is taken from Customer Profile Data from the eshop

### Sales contact confirmation

Depending on the setup of the e-shop, a second confirmation email is sent to a sales contact. This address is also stored to the basket entity parallel to the customer's address. The behaviour is configurable:

#### `siso_checkout.default.order_confirmation.sales_email_mode`

Possible values:

- `config`
    - The sales contact's email address will be read from the config (the second parameter below)
- `customer`
    - The sales contact's email address will be read from salesContactEmail from sesUser from the [customer's profile data](Customer-profile-data-model_23560898.html).
    - If no address could be found in the contact data, the configuration parameter below is used as the default.

#### `siso_checkout.default.order_confirmation.sales_email_address`

This parameter MAY be set to a valid email address of the sales contact person. If it's left empty, no sales contact confirmations are sent, except if the sales_email_mode above is set to "customer" and the respective profile data contains a valid address.

## OrderConfirmationListener

In order to send the order confirmations as soon as an order was successfully accepted by the ERP, a symfony event listener was created:

`\Siso\Bundle\CheckoutBundle\EventListener\OrderConfirmationListener`

This class is configured as a service, which listens to the event `silver_eshop.exception_message`. If the response contains an ERP order number, it is considered as successfull and the confirmation mails are sent as configured. The following parameters are used:

``` yaml
siso_core.default.ses_swiftmailer:
    mailSender: "mail@example.com"
siso_checkout.default.order_confirmation_subject: "Email subject"
```

## Order confirmation E-Mail

The order confirmation is sent via the `MailHelperService`.  
The confirmation action searches for the basket with the given ID and state "confirmed".

``` 
$basket = $this->getBasket($request, BasketService::STATE_CONFIRMED, $basketId);
```
