# 4.1 Foundation framework

Foundation framework is our base point for handling front-end in general. We decided to use one of the most popular frameworks to speed up our work and have always up to date base that follows changes on the market.

## Foundation basics

Our documentation focuses on the basics and most common components we use.

### Mobile first

One of our main goals when building new front-end layout for eZ Commerce was to make it really mobile friendly. Since we decided to use Foundation framework there was no other way that mobile first (which we really like).

Mobile first means that we start from the mobile device perspective and adjust it when the screen size/resolutions gets bigger. To find out more about mobile first approach please read a full article on that topic at: <http://zurb.com/word/mobile-first>. 

### Grid system

Foundation has very flexible grid system based on percentages values (%). No more pixel values. It gives us the opportunity to build nested grid system with ease. 

#### Basics

Start with wrapper with a class of .row. Then add children elements with a column (or columns) class inside that row. You can specify the width of each column using small, medium, large and xlarge prefix. 

Foundation grid system by default is a 12 column grid and this is how we use it. It can be easily changed in the configuration.

**Foundation is mobile-first**. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.

``` html+twig
<div class="row">
  <div class="small-2 large-4 columns">...
  <div class="small-4 large-4 columns">...
  <div class="small-6 large-4 columns">...

<div class="row">
  <div class="large-3 columns">...
  <div class="large-6 columns">...
  <div class="large-3 columns">...
```

##### TIP: Full width row

To make a full width row user row and column like this:

``` html+twig
<div class="row">
  <div class="columns">
```

This way your content will always stay in the sam constraints like the one with multiple columns.

#### Nesting

Since our grid is based on % values we can rows and columns as deep as we want. 

``` html+twig
<div class="row">
  <div class="small-8 columns">8
    <div class="row">
      <div class="small-8 columns">8 Nested
        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-8 columns">8 Nested Again
          <div class="small-4 columns">4

      <div class="small-4 columns">4

  <div class="small-4 columns">4
```

As you can see nested row contains two columns which sums up to 12. This is really important to understand. The sum in almost every case for columns inside one row should be 12. If it's bigger everything that's bigger than 12 will go to the next row, when it's smaller it will stay as wide as it was defined.

#### Customize with Sass

In order to customize gird setting please edit `scss/settings/_foundation.scss` file

```
$row-width: rem-calc(1200);
$column-gutter: rem-calc(30);
$total-columns: 12;
```

These are our default settings when it comes to grid:

- 1200 - maximum width of each row (`.row` class) in pixels which is converted into rem values
- 30 - gutter (space) between columns in pixels which is converted to rem
- 12 - total number of columns  

Keep in mind if you change `$total-columns` you should most likely adjust your grid in each template.

## Colors

Foundation comes with a list o predefined colors. This makes really easy to build themes pretty fast. 

### Basic colors:

```
$primary-color: #2574A9;
$secondary-color: #34495E;
$alert-color: $flat-alizarin;
$success-color: $flat-nephritis;
$warning-color: $flat-carrot;
$info-color: $flat-peter-river;
```

As a base we use primary and secondary color. Additionally there are 4 more colors defined to attract the attentions (we call them action colors). 

We have introduced an extra color palette. We use FlatUI Color from <https://flatuicolors.com/>. Colors are transferred into an easy to use variables. File is located here: ` scss/settings/_colors.flat.scss.  `Here's the full list of these colors

**scss/settings/\_colors.flat.scss**

``` 
// FlatUI Colors
// Greens
$flat-turquoise: #1ABC9C;
$flat-green-sea: #16A085;
$flat-emerald: #2ECC71;
$flat-nephritis: #27AE60;

// Blues
$flat-peter-river: #3498DB;
$flat-belize-hole: #2980B9;
$flat-wet-asphalt: #34495E;
$flat-midnight-blue: #2C3E50;

// Purples
$flat-amethyst: #9B59B6;
$flat-wisteria: #8E44AD;

// Yellows
$flat-sunflower: #F1C40F;

// Oranges
$flat-orange: #F39C12;
$flat-carrot: #E67E22;
$flat-pumpkin: #D35400;

// Reds
$flat-alizarin: #E74C3C;
$flat-pomegranate: #C0392B;

// Grays
$flat-clouds: #ECF0F1;
$flat-silver: #BDC3C7;
$flat-concrete: #95A5A6;
$flat-asbestos: #7F8C8D;
```

If you would like to introduce different colors just create a new file in settings folder and include it styles.scss.

## Visibility classes

Visibility classes let you show or hide elements based on screen size or device orientation. You can use visibility classes to control which elements users see depending on their browsing environment.

### Show by screen size 

In this example, we use the **show** visibility classes to show certain strings of text based on the device on which users view a page. If their browser meets the class's conditions, the element will be shown. If not, it will be hidden.

``` 
<strong class="show-for-small-only">This text is shown only on a small screen.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-medium-up">This text is shown on medium screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-medium-only">This text is shown only on a medium screen.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-large-up">This text is shown on large screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-large-only">This text is shown only on a large screen.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-xlarge-up">This text is shown on xlarge screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-xlarge-only">This text is shown only on an xlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="show-for-xxlarge-up">This text is shown on xxlarge screens and up.</strong>
```

### Hide by screen size

This example shows the opposite: It uses the **hide** visibility classes to state which elements should disappear based on your device's screen size or orientation. Users will see elements on every browser **except** those that meet these conditions.

``` 
<strong class="hide-for-small-only">You are <em>not</em> on a small screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-medium-up">You are <em>not</em> on a medium, large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-medium-only">You are <em>not</em> on a medium screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-large-up">You are <em>not</em> on a large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-large-only">You are <em>not</em> on a large screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-xlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen and up.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-xlarge-only">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hide-for-xxlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xxlarge screen.</strong>
```

### Responsive visiblity

Finally, if you want to hide some content but still make it accessible for screen readers, use the **hidden** visibility classes. Do not confuse these classes with **hide** visibility classes. Use these classes in conjunction with the **hide** and **show** visibility classes to control complex layouts while offering accessibility for those using screen readers.

``` 
<strong class="hidden-for-small-only">You are <em>not</em> on a small screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-medium-up">You are <em>not</em> on a medium, large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-medium-only">You are <em>not</em> on a medium screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-large-up">You are <em>not</em> on a large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-large-only">You are <em>not</em> on a large screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-xlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen and up.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-xlarge-only">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="hidden-for-xxlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xxlarge screen.</strong>
```

To reverse the rules defined by **hidden**, use the **visible** visibility classes.

``` 
<strong class="visible-for-small-only">This text is shown only on a small screen.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-medium-up">This text is shown on medium screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-medium-only">This text is shown only on a medium screen.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-large-up">This text is shown on large screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-large-only">This text is shown only on a large screen.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-xlarge-up">This text is shown on xlarge screens and up.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-xlarge-only">This text is shown only on an xlarge screen.</strong>
<strong class="visible-for-xxlarge-up">This text is shown on xxlarge screens and up.</strong>
```

### Print visibility

Foundation includes a couple of simple classes you can use to control elements printing, or not printing. Simply attach `.show-for-print` to an element to only show when printing, and `.hide-for-print` to hide something when printing.

More about visibility classes can be found at the official documentation: <http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/visibility.html>

## Utility classes

Foundation includes a handful of helpful utility classes to add certain behaviors to your elements.

#### Float classes 

You can change the float behavior of an element by adding `.left` or `.right` to an HTML element. To clear floats, add the class `.clearfix` to the parent element.

#### Radius and Rounded

The `.radius` and `.round` classes allow you to easily apply a border-radius to a UI-element. Adding the class to a button group will apply the border radius only to the outside corners.

#### Text Align Classes

You can change the text alignment of an element by adding `.text-left`, `.text-right`, `.text-center` or `.text-justify` to an element.

Adding a size to the front of a text alignment class will cause it to only be applied on that size screen or larger (ex. `.medium-text-center` will center text for everything except small screens). Adding a size and only will apply the text alignment just for that media query (ex. `.medium-only-text-center` will center text just for medium screens).

#### Hide an Element

You can add the class `.hide` to an element to hide it. This will add the property `display: none` to the element.

## Foundation components

Foundation comes with handful of ready to use components.

#### Enable / disable Foundation's components

Usually there is no need to include complete Foundation in your project. Main reason behind this approach is performance (smaller file size, faster page load). 

If you want enable / disable a component just go to `scss/style.scss` file and find a components sections in there. 

##### Enabling Sass component

In order to **enable** a component remove two forward slashes (Scss comment) at the beginning of the line:

``` 
// before
//@import "../vendor/foundation/scss/foundation/components/clearing";
 
// after
@import "../vendor/foundation/scss/foundation/components/clearing";
```

##### Disabling Sass compontnet

In order to **disable** a component just place two forward slashes at the beginning of the line.

``` 
// before
@import "../vendor/foundation/scss/foundation/components/clearing";
 
// after
//@import "../vendor/foundation/scss/foundation/components/clearing";
```

##### Important note

!!! note

    Some components are strictly related to JavaScript. Please keep mind while enabling / disabling them.

#### Configure Foundation's components

Thanks to Sass (SCSS) we can configure almost everything for each individual component. Main configuration file is located here: `scss/settings/_foundation.scss`.

In order to change some configuration open `scss/settings/_foundation.scss` and find section / component that you want to change. At the top of file there a big table of contents which helps to navigate through the file. What might be helpful is of course official Foundation documentation. In the table above there are links to each component. In the official docs you should be able to find "Customize with Sass" section. This is what you are looking for.

**Breadcrumb component configuration - example**

``` 
// 04. Breadcrumbs
// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

// $include-html-nav-classes: $include-html-classes;

// We use this to set the background color for the breadcrumb container.
$crumb-bg: scale-color($white, $lightness: -5%);

// We use these to set the padding around the breadcrumbs.
$crumb-padding: rem-calc(12 15);
// $crumb-side-padding: rem-calc(12);
```

#### Enable / disable Foundation's components

Like for CSS components there is no need to load all of JavaScript components for the same reason - performance. 

##### Enabling JavaScript component

In order to **enable** a component you need to include it in the `Resources/views/pagelayout.html.twig`. Locate javascript block at the bottom of the file.

``` 
{% block javascripts %}
...
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.alert.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.dropdown.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.equalizer.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.offcanvas.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.reveal.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tab.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tooltip.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js'
...
{% endblock %}
```

And now let's assume that you want to add an **Abide** JavaScript form validation. 

``` 
{% block javascripts %}
...
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.abide.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.alert.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.dropdown.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.equalizer.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.offcanvas.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.reveal.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tab.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tooltip.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js'
...
{% endblock %}
```

Please keep an alphabetical order of files for faster inspections if needed.

##### Disabling JavaScript component

If you want to disable / remove a component just remove appropriate line in `Resources/views/pagelayout.html.twig.`

``` 
{% block javascripts %}
...
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.abide.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.alert.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.dropdown.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.equalizer.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.offcanvas.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.reveal.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tab.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tooltip.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js'
...
{% endblock %}
```

As an example let's assume that you want to remove a tooltip component.

``` 
{% block javascripts %}
...
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.abide.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.alert.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.dropdown.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.equalizer.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.offcanvas.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.reveal.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.tab.js'
  'bundles/silversolutionseshop/vendor/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js'
...
{% endblock %}
```

##### Important notes

1.  Keep in mind that you should clean up HTML structure / configuration after removing a component.
2.  Some components are strictly related to JavaScript. Please keep mind while enabling / disabling them.

!!! caution

    There is no need to initialize Foundation by calling $(document).foundation();. It's done in a separate file for you.

#### Configure JavaScript components

There are two ways of configuring JavaScript components in Foundation. 

To get detailed information about specific settings please visit official documentation. Each JavaScript component has a dedicated section which is called "**Using the JavaScript**"

##### Use data-options HTML attribute

Most of JavaScript component supports this type of configuration. The upside of this solutions is flexibility. Just imagine having the same component used in different places on the page and configured differently for each of situations.

To make use of this solution define a data-options attribute with some settings inside. Each property: value needs be separated with a semicolon.

``` 
<... data-options="property: value; property: value;"> ... </..>
```

!!! tip

    We recommend using this solution.

###### Tooltip example:

``` 
<span data-tooltip data-options="hover_delay: 50; disable_for_touch: true" class="has-tip" title="Tooltips are awesome, you should totally use them!">...
```

##### Configure directly in JavaScript

If you prefer you can configure every JavaScript component directly in JavaScript. In order to do this you need to pass a JavaScript object to $(document).foundation() function.

``` 
$(document).foundation({
  tooltip: {
    hover_delay: 50,
    disable_for_touch: true
  }
});
```

If you want to configure multiple components you can do it this way:

**Tooltip and dropdown configuration - example**

``` 
$(document).foundation({
  tooltip: {
    hover_delay: 50,
    disable_for_touch: true
  },
  dropdown: {
    active_class: 'current'
  }
});
```
