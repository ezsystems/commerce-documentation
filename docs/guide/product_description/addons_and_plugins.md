### Customer center

The customer center offers B2B advantages especially for large customers.

Via the user management feature, customers are able to grant their own employees access to the shop. It improves the purchasing process since it offers features such as:

- Budget management
- Approval functions for orders
- Different roles and rights

The customer center can be connected to the ERP system and synchronizes customer data and contact data when required. In that case the ERP also controls which customer can use the customer center. 

If a customer has a customer center all employees are stored beneath the company folder. The shop administrator has a good overview of the company and its related employees with a shop account. 

The customer center will enhance the eZ Commerce processes such as:

- Registration
- Login
- Checkout
- Customer center management

### Olark chat tool

Olark is a powerful chat tool which offers more than a normal chat. The shop is able to forward the name of a user (if logged in) to the service employee. Besides a chat functionality the service employee can assist the customer e.g. in pointing them to the correct place in the shop ("!push /Produkt-Katalog/Mikrofone/URM-Serie"). If no support employee is available, the conversion will be send by email. 

The chat tool can be enabled in the configuration settings of eZCommerce.
