# 4.2.6 - Custom fonts

Introduced in version 3.3.3

Custom fonts are stored inside: and they may contain any custom font face including icon fonts.

# Custom icon fonts

Primarily we use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), but sometimes there are situation that it's not possible to find the right icon in [Font Awesome set](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). 

In order to manage custom icon fonts we use this online tool: <http://fontello.com/>. It's pretty straight forward to use it:

1. Search for the icon you want to use
1. Click on it in order to select it (click on more time to deselect)
1. Download the set

!!! note

    Fontello also supports Font Awesome. Please don't include any of Font Awesome icons inside your custom build because they are already included. The image above is just an example.

## Using custom icon fonts

### List of custom icons

| Icon                                                                                         | CSS class    |

| ![](../../../img/custom_fonts_2.png) | .icon-wrench |

### Basic usage:

``` 
<i class="icon-wrench"></i>
```

In some cases e.g. line height of the icon is not correct you can mix it with base class for Font Awesome like this:

``` 
<i class="fa icon-wrench"></i>
```

*.fa is a base class for Font Awesome*
