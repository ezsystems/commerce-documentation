# Term - VatCode

**VatCode** is a code (e.g. 'download', 'food'...) which defines which kind of VAT (%) applies to a product. The VatCode is stored in a ProductNode. 

The Code usually is provided by the ERP-system or PIM. eZ Commerce provides a configuration which maps the Code to the corresponding VAT in percent.
