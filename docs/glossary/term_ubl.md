Extract from Wikipedia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Business_Language>):

**Universal Business Language** (**UBL**) is a library of standard electronic [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") business documents such as [purchase orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_order "Purchase order") and [invoices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invoice "Invoice"). UBL was developed by an [OASIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_\(organization\) "OASIS (organization)") Technical Committee with participation from a variety of industry data standards organizations. UBL is designed to plug directly into existing business, legal, auditing, and records management practices.<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Business_Language#cite_note-1)</sup> It is designed to eliminate the [re-keying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_entry_clerk "Data entry clerk") of data in existing fax- and paper-based business correspondence and provide an entry point into [electronic commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_commerce "Electronic commerce") for small and medium-sized businesses.
