# Customer Center

## Introduction

The customer-center is a plugin for eZ Commerce.

The customer-center is an add-on and not part of the standard shop. 

The customer-center offers advantages especially for large B2B customers.

Via the user management feature, customers are able to manage the shop accounts and rights for their employees.

It improves the purchasing process since it offers features such as:

- Budget management
- Approval functions for order inquiries, orders and budgets
- Different roles per employee

The customer-center is connected to the ERP system and synchronizes customer data and contact data when required. The ERP also controls which customer can use the customer-center. 

When  customer-center is activated in a shop all employees will be stored hierachically in a company folder. The shop administrator and the main contact of each company will have a good overview of the company and its related employees in a shop account. 

The customer-center will enhance the eZ Commerce processes such as:

- Registration
- Login
- Checkout
- Customer-center management
