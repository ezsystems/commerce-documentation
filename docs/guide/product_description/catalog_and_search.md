# Catalog and search

## The catalog

The catalog is built using categories and products that can be translated. 

Categories and products can be set up as Content items, or in eContent. eContent is a storage provider for eZ Commerce which can store product data in a very efficient way. It enables storing data (mostly for products and product groups) in database tables with a simple structure.

- Fast imports (e.g. from ERP or PIM systems)
- Supports more than one million products
- Search-ready
- Fast access
- Avoids storing products in the CMS content model
- eContent offers a staging feature and enhanced catalog segmentation features and allows imports during production and switching catalogs.

Additionally a PIM system can be used to manage all product data.

eZ Commerce is prepared to sell physical products. It can be enhanced by partners to sell other products such as digital products.

### Categories/Product groups

![product catalog](img/product_catalog_2.png)

A category represents a product group. eZ Commerce enables showing a product category page using different layouts. The layout can be configured in the backend.

Three different layouts are provided by default (displaying sub-categories, product list or both on the entry page of a category). In the Back Office you can also configure if bestsellers of the group should be displayed.

#### Display product directly

#### Display only subcategories

These can have sev3ral levels of subcategories. On the last level the product list is shown.

#### Display subcategories and product list

### Product list view

The product list offers two different views (grid and list). From the list view the user can directly add a product (if it is not a variant product) to basket, wishlist or comparison or go to the product detail page.

The catalog shows filters depending on the displayed products and their attributes.

### Product type

A product type (not to be confused with variants) represents a collection of very similar products that differ only in some characteristics. It is used to show a list of products in a tabular way, every product can be added to the basket directly from overview page.

### Product detail

A product can have:

- one or more images (in the standard config up to 3),
- an SKU
- text fields (name, description, intro)
- specifications offering different groups of data as marketing data, technical data, others depending on the data that have been created in the backend

From the product detail the user can directly add a product to basket, wishlist, comparison or stored basket.

### Variant product
	
eZ Commerce supports variants with one or two levels.
The user can choose a first attribute, the shop will then narrow down the options for the second level.

The user can change the variant selection in the basket.

### Product comparison

A customer can compare products in a comparison list. The comparison list automatically groups products per product category (so e.g. mixer cannot be compared to microwave).
The customer can change the order of the sorting by dragging and can display differences of the products only.

### Wishlist

After login customers can add products to a personal wishlist. Products that are not in the active catalog any more are automatically marked as "not available".

### Stored baskets

Customers with a login can store named baskets and can reuse them later on for recurring orders.

## Search and filtering

All data such as products and content is indexed in a powerful search engine (Solr). 

### Search

The integrated search engine offers one global search for products and content in the system:

- products 
- content such as blog entries, news, articles
- assets such as downloads

It respects the permissions and Roles of the customer.

### Filters and facets

Almost all product Fields can be used as a facet if they are indexed. This can be controlled by a configuration file which enables setting up different facets for the product catalog and search.

Facets can be grouped. For more complex facets new fields can be implemented using the IndexPlugin features of Solr search.

!!! note

	There are restrictions for variants, it is not possible to mix the variant attributes as facets if the same attribute is set for main products.

### Autosuggest

The autosuggest feature offers suggestion as you type and enables adding an available product to the basket directly from the search box. It matches products, categories, downloads and content based on the name that starts with the search term.
