## With ERP connection only  
  
When an ERP system is used the orders will be transferred to the ERP. When an ERP is connected the shop does not create invoices, so no invoice will be available in the order management. Nevertheless the online orders can be checked in this section. 

In addition there is one important service functionality - the Lost Orders.

### Lost orders 

**What happens when an order cannot be transferred to the ERP**

Since the ERP system might not be up and running eZ Commerce is able to store the orders and retransmit orders when the ERP is working.  The orders are stored in a database table and marked for retransmission. The shop records the number of retries. By default the maximum number is 3 (siso\_checkout.default.max\_failed\_order).

The shop will send an email to the shop administrator describing details about the order:

**Reason why an order could not be sent to the ERP**

There may be a lot of reasons for why an order has not been send to the ERP system. It depends on the ERP system if an approbate error message can be provided.

The error message varies as well. Some examples:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Reason</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ERP offline</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection from shop to ERP is not working</td>
<td><p>In this case a message such as</p>
<ul>
<li>"Cannot connect to host" </li>
<li>Send of message XXXXX failed (Navision)</li>
</ul>
<p>may be documented.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer blocked</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Credit limit reached</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Invalid fields in the order</td>
<td><p>The shops send e.g. a country code which isnÂ´t setup in the ERP.</p>
<p><br />
</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Invalid SKU</td>
<td>This might happen if a sku has been imported which is remove in the ERP system</td>
</tr>
