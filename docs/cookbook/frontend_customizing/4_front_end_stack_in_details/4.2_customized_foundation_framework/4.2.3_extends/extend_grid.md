# Extend - Grid

Extends: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/grid.html

## What/why do we extend?

1. For our breakpoint needs we had to introduce xlarge grid which is not included in the standard. With this addition classes like xlarge-12, xlarge-6, etc. for columns are supported.

## Sass:

**File location**

``` 
scss/storm/_extend.components.grid.scss
