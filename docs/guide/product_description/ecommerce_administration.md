## Order management

Orders are stored in the backend and can be filtered by date, status or payment information. An export function allows to export the data as XML file.

If the shop is used without ERP integration invoices can be managed as well.

## Configuration

The configuration settings in the backend enable configuring the main behavior for the shop. In addition currency, payment and shipping options can be set per country (SiteAccess). The configuration is stored using the version control features of the CMS. More advanced settings (e.g. VAT for different countries) can be set up in configuration files.

## Price and shipping cost management

The Price and shipping costs management enables setting up prices and stock when the shop price provider (`siso_price.price_provider.shop`) is configured for calculating prices.
