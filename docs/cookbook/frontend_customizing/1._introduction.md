# 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an information and instructions about front-end part of eZ Commerce which is called internally Storm. It describes technologies and processes behind creating nice looking and efficient front-end layer for your shop. Main aim of this document is to help developers understand our approach for building front-end.

Currently eZ Commerce comes with one standard theme which can be easily extended and changed but we plan to have more out of the box themes in the future.

## 1.1 Prerequisites

In order to implement what is covered in this documentation you should be familiar with these technologies:

- CSS/CSS3
- HTML/HTML5
- JavaScript
- Responsive Web Design (RWD)

## 1.2 Technologies we use

1.  As our base we decided to use [Foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
2.  We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) to help us speed up the work when it comes to CSS.
3.  We use [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as our templating language.
4.  We use mostly [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and a bit of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) when it comes to JavaScript. Sometime we use plain vanilla JavaScript as well.  

All of this will be described in details in the following chapters.

## 1.3 Browser / devices support

Since we use Foundation framework as our base we try to follow the same browser and device support.

| Browser/OS                  | The Grid | Layout/UI | JavaScipt |
| --------------------------- | :------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Google Chrome               |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Mozilla Firefox             |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Safari                      |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Internet Explorer 11        |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Internet Explorer 10        |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Internet Explorer 9         |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Internet Explorer 8         |    x     |     x     |     x     |
| Internet Explorer 7         |    x     |     x     |     x     |
| iOS (iPhone)                |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| iOS (iPad)                  |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Android 2, 4, 5, 6 (Phone)  |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Android 2, 4, 5, 6 (Tablet) |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Windows Phone 7+            |    √     |     √     |     √     |
| Surface                     |    √     |     √     |     √     |

It is possible to support old, legacy browsers like Internet Explored 8 but it required an extra effort and it's not supported in our standard solution.
