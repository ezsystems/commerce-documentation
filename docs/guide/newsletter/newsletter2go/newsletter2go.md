## Introduction

silver.e-shop offers a newsletter interface. This allows user to un/subscribe from/to newsletters and see the newsletter status or update newsletter details information in his profile.

Newsletter2Go offers several address books. The reason is, that user can be stored in one, or several address books. One address books equals one newsletter topic, so user can choose, if he wants to subscribe e.g. on food, clothes and technique separately.

Usage of several address books is optional and by default there is the default address book.

silver.e-shop in standard works with default address book only. See [FAQ](newsletter2go_faq.md), if you want to support several address books in your project.

In Newsletter2Go backend the address book can be choosen in the header menu. Every address book has a different dashboard with different mailings, receivers and reports.
