# Breadcrumbs

eZ Commerce supports generation of breadcrumbs throughout the shop.
In every part of the shop there is at least one generator responsible for creating breadcrumbs.

Breadcrumbs are generated using a general template called from `pagelayout.html.twig`.
There is no need to define the HTML code in full templates:

``` html+twig
{% block breadcrumb %}
        <div class="crumb-wrap hide-for-print">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="columns">
              {% render(controller('SilversolutionsEshopBundle:Breadcrumbs:renderBreadcrumbs')) %}

{% endblock %} 
```

It uses [schema.org markup](http://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) for generating the HTML tags. 

The breadcrumb system uses the [WhiteOctober breadcrumbs bundle](https://github.com/whiteoctober/BreadcrumbsBundle).

## Features

eZ Commerce breadcrumbs support:

- creation of breadcrumbs for catalog elements (e.g. products, categories)
- creation of breadcrumbs for internal shop routes (e.g. my profile, search)
- creation of breadcrumbs for eZ Platform content
- creation of breadcrumbs for special eZ Commerce forms (e.g. contact form)
- different data providers as products may come from different sources
- generation of breadcrumbs for multiple product catalogs
- storage of additional data in `translationParameters`
- configuration for content Fields that should be used as breadcrumb labels

## Configuration

You can configure the Fields that should be used as labels for breadcrumb nodes.
The first match wins.

``` yaml
parameters:
    siso_core.default.breadcrumb_content_label_fields: ['name', 'title']
```
