#  Template set and design 

eZ Commerce and ses%brand-advanced come with a set of templates and a standard design.

1.  Our custom frontend Framework is based on [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
2.  We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) to help us speed up the work when it comes to CSS.
3.  We use [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as our templating language.
4.  We use mostly [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and a bit of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) when it comes to JavaScript. Sometime we use plain vanilla JavaScript as well.

In addition to the Foundation Framework we created some components that focus on eCommerce features like a product card design or the basket and checkout layouts.

The basic shop templates are responsive. Design can be adapted using build in template resolver.
