# Manage products and categories with the eContent DB

silver.eShop supports different sources for the catalog data.

Product data can be managed in the backend of the shop using content types.

Or the product data can be imported from other sources, usually from the ERP or from a PIM system. In that case the product data will not be stored in the shop backend, but in a separate data base -  called eContent.

eContent is a storage provider for silver.eShop 4 which can store product data in a very efficient way. It allows to store data (mostly for products and product groups) in database tables with an optimised structure.

The advantages of the eContent data base are:

- Fast imports (e.g. from ERP or PIM systems)
- Supports more than one million products
- eContent offers a staging feature which allows imports during production and switching catalogs
- Enhanced catalog segmentation features
