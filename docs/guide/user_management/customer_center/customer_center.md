# Customer center

Customer center is an optional plugin for eZ Commerce. It is not part of the standard shop. 

Customer center offers advantages especially for large B2B customers.
It enables customers to manage shop accounts and permissions for their employees.

It also improves the purchasing process thanks to features such as:

- Budget management
- Approval functions for order inquiries, orders and budgets
- Different roles per employee

Customer center is connected to the ERP system and synchronizes customer data and contact data when required.
The ERP also controls which customer can use the Customer center. 

When Customer center is activated in a shop, all employees are stored hierarchically in a company folder.
The shop administrator and the main contact of each company have an overview of the company and its employees in the shop account. 

The Customer center enhances shop processes such as:

- Registration
- Login
- Checkout
