#  Term - Monolog 

Monolog is a PHP library for logging. It provides classes and interfaces in order to implement basic and more sophisticated logging set-ups. It is also very easy to extend the base implementations of Monolog with its concept of Loggers, Handlers, Processors and Formatters. The basic documentation of these features is not in the scope of this document. Please refer to the [Monolog documentation for an introduction](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/tree/master/doc).
