# Product comparison

## Introduction

eZ Commerce offers feature to compare desired products on a single page. Customers can save products on their own comparison lists. The product will be saved on comparison list depending on it's type (like speakers, microphones). 

Additionally there is a functionality for displaying "Public Comparison List". It's a special comparison list, which can be set by the shop administrator, for which the customers can just view them and are not allowed to modify the list. It's very useful for showing fixed comparison list (eg. top microphones) by placing it's link on the website. 

This feature is available **for all** the customers ( both logged and anonymous ).

The comparison function is based on the basket system of eZ Commerce.
