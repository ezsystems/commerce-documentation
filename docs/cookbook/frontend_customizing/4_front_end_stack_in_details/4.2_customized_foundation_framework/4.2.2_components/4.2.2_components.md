Storm components are located in

## How to create a new component

1.  Go to vendor/silversolutions/silver.e-shop/src/Silversolutions/Bundle/EshopBundle/Resources/public/scss/storm and create new file file that follows our naming convention **\_components.YOUR\_COMPONENT.scss**
2.  Make sure newly created component is included in vendor/silversolutions/silver.e-shop/src/Silversolutions/Bundle/EshopBundle/Resources/public/scss/style.scss in the components section (Storm components section). Please keep in mind alphabetical order of component files.
3.  Write the code you need in you newly created component.

## How to extend a component

Since we use Foundation framework and a lot of other third party it often happens that basic functionality is already there. The only thing you need to do is to extend / override. 

1.  Go to vendor/silversolutions/silver.e-shop/src/Silversolutions/Bundle/EshopBundle/Resources/public/scss/storm and create new file file that follows our naming convention **\_extend.components.YOUR\_COMPONENT.scss**
2.  Make sure newly created component is included in vendor/silversolutions/silver.e-shop/src/Silversolutions/Bundle/EshopBundle/Resources/public/scss/style.scss in the components section (Extend Foundation components). Please keep in mind alphabetical order of component files.
3.  Write the code you need in you newly created component.**
