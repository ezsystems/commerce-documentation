#  Extend - Visibility 

Extends: <http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/visibility.html>

## What/why do we extend?

1.  Since we don't include all print CSS from Foundation we had to take out on of the classes we use in order to hide some content for print

## Sass

**File location**

``` 
scss/storm/_extend.components.visibility.scss
```

### Available classes

``` 
.hide-for-print
```

*Apply this class to every element that you want to hide on print.*
