# Frontend customizing

## Introduction

In this section you'll find detailed documentation about handling front-end inside eZ Commerce. It's divided into multiple sections (take a look at the Child pages tree in the column on the right)

## Before you start

Please keep in mind that front-end is really connected with a lot of topics. As a front-end developer working with our shop you need to be familiar with these technologies:

- CSS (Sass)
- HTML5
- JavaScript (mostly jQuery but also Backbone.js)
- Twig
- Gulp

We strongly encourage you to read those pages first:

- [1. Introduction](1._introduction.md)
- [3. Templates](3._templates.md)
- [4.6 Coding Standards](4_front_end_stack_in_details/4.6_coding_standards/css_sass.md)

Having basic knowledge will help you digest the rest much easier.
