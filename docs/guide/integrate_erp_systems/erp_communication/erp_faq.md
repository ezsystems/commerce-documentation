Q: Solution for Exception The message object could not be determined. Probably no respective service was registered to the message identifier: "SelectItemMessage"

A: When the message has been generated a new yml file has been produced.

The yml file has to be included. usually all yml files generated by the ERP command line script will be defined in the parameters.yml file in your bundle.

This file has to be loaded e.g. in your app/config/config.yml file.
