# Templates and design

eZ Commerce comes with a set of templates and a standard design.

1. Our custom frontend Framework is based on [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
2. We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS) to help us speed up the work when it comes to CSS.
3. We use [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as our templating language.
4. We use mostly [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and a bit of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) when it comes to JavaScript. We also use plain vanilla JavaScript.

In addition to the Foundation Framework we created components that focus on eCommerce features like a product card design or the basket and checkout layouts.

The basic shop templates are responsive. Design can be adapted using a built-in template resolver.
