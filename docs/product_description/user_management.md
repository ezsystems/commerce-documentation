#  User Management 

## Users

silver.eShop users are stored as eZ Users. This enables the shop owner to use the full power of the rights and role system of the CMS.

In addition a shop owner gets infos about the last orders and the sales statistics of the customer. If a user has a current basket it is displayed as well.
