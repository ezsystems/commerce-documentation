# EzContentBreadcrumbsGenerator

This generator renders the breadcrumbs for standard eZ Platform content.  

## FQN

Silversolutions\\Bundle\\EshopBundle\\Service\\Breadcrumbs\\EzContentBreadcrumbsGenerator

## Criterion for responsibility

The generator triggers if the session attribute 'location' is set. This is set by some eZ routine in the case the router matched eZ content.

## Notes to the rendering process

Renders all elements of the path of the currently displayed content location as breadcrumbs, up to the eZ content root.
