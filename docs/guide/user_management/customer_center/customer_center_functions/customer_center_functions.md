# Customer center functions

!!! note

    The Customer center is available for customers who have a flag enabling it in the ERP.
    The ERP provides two important fields:

    - flag which indicated that the company has a Customer center
    - email address of the Customer center administrator

## Activate the Customer center

During account activation the shop checks if the customer has access to the Customer center.
For a successful activation you need:

- a customer number
- an invoice number
- an email address which is defined in the ERP as a main contact

If Customer center is enabled for the customer, the shop creates a company. A main contact is assigned to the company in the User section of the Back Office.
If no Customer center is defined for the customer, a standard user is created in the section "Business users"
